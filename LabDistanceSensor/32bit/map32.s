@ openRWSync
@ Opens the device in read and write mode + synchronize and 
@ returns the file descriptor.
@ Calling sequence:
@		r0 <- device address
@		bl openRWSync
@ Output:
@		r0 <- file descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred
openRWSync:
	push	{r4, lr}

@ Open the device for read/write and syncing        
        ldr     r1, openMode    @ flags for accessing device
        bl      open

	pop	{r4, lr}
	bx lr

@ mapMemory
@ Maps the memory.
@ Calling sequence:
@		r0<- file descriptor
@		r1<- pointer to the address of the programming memory
@		bl mapMemory
@ Output:
@		r0<- the mapped address or -1 if an error occurred
mapMemory:
	push	{r4, r5, r6, lr}

	mov     r4, r0          @ use r4 for file descriptor
	mov 	r5, r1		@ programming memory 

@ Map the registers to a main memory location so we can access them
	push 	{r4, r5}
        mov     r0, NO_PREF     @ let kernel pick memory
        mov     r1, PAGE_SIZE   @ get 1 page of memory
        mov     r2, PROT_RDWR   @ read/write this memory
        mov     r3, MAP_SHARED  @ share with other processes
        bl      mmap
	pop	{r4, r5}

	pop	{r4, r5, r6, lr}
	bx lr

@ closeDevice
@ Unmaps the memory allocated to the device and closes it
@ Calling sequence:
@		r0<-address of the mapped memory
@		r1<-file descriptor
@		bl closeDevice
closeDevice:
	push	{r4, lr}
	mov	r4, r1		@ file descriptor
        mov     r1, PAGE_SIZE   @ amount we mapped
        bl      munmap          @ unmap it

        mov     r0, r4          @ file descriptor
        bl      close           @ close the file
